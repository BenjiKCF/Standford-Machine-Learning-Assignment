Classic Machine Learning material from Andrew Ng. Matlab and Octave codes for assignments and optional exercises.

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. 

In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. 

Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI.
